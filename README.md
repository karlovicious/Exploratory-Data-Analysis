# Exploratory-Data-Analysis, Assignment 1

## This is my submission for Exploratory Data Analysis, Assignment 1 on Coursera.

### Each file is posted as requested; you only need to import and clean the data once to reproduce the plots - although each script replicates the same clean-up code.

### I have previously completed the assignment for a section that I did not finish. New submission, but same commit from back in December.
